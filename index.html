                    Christopher Nolan’s movie Interstellar is one of the most beautifully depicted space films ever produced.
                    From using Einstein’s theory of relativity to supermassive black holes, the movie uses actual physics to 
                    enhance the story. Supermassive black holes are one of the most powerful things in space, with it’s mass 
                    and gravity able to stop even light from escaping. Einstein’s theory of relativity allows for time dilation
                    seen in the movie, in which time moves differently at different points of space, and the theory of wormholes
                    are explained.

                    “Active Learning (Angluin, 1988, Cohn et al., 1994) is a paradigm where a concept is learnt by an
                    intelligent machine through the interaction of an oracle with the machine system, over a sequence of
                    learning epochs. A distinctive component in an active system is the querying strategy, used to sample
                    candidate training instances from a pool and evaluate them for informativeness, i.e., their potential
                    to improve the classification model. Various strategies have been proposed including; Query by
                    Committee (Seung et al., 1992), Monte Carlo estimation (Roy and McCallum, 2001), uncertainty
                    sampling (Lewis and Gale, 1994) and version space reduction (margin sampling) (Tong and Koller,
                    2001). Irrespective of how the most informative pattern instances are chosen at each epoch they are
                    presented for labeling, to a machine (database) or human oracle that has knowledge of the class
                    labels. After adding the newly labeled instances to the current training set, a revised model is
                    subsequently induced. A goal of this process is to achieve an efficient, incremental advancement of
                    learning at each epoch. The process is continued until some stopping criterion has been met, such as
                    reaching a stage where information from the selected instances is contrary to the model, causing the
                    classifier confidence to drop, as in Vlachos (2008).”

                The supermassive black hole Gargantua (Figure 1) was one of the most significant parts of the movie. 
                The production the black hole within the movie had immense amounts of research behind it, as it was 
                extremely hard to visualise black holes, with the nearest one residing around 27,000 light years away. 
                (Interesting Engineering, 2016) Supermassive black holes are black holes which are more than 100,000 
                times the mass of the sun and are thought to be the centre of all large galaxies, including the milky 
                way. (Supermassive black hole, 2020) It is unknown how they are formed in the first place, but a theory
                is that pairs of black holes crash into one another which forms a single larger black hole, which was 
                discovered in 2015 with evidence from gravitational waves. For example, the largest supermassive black
                hole is Abell 1201 (Supermassive black hole, 2020), which is 30 million times the size of the sun. 
                Regular sized black holes, up to 20 times the mass of the sun is created when large stars collapse upon 
                itself when it runs out of fuel, causing a supernova explosion. The mass of the star will start collapsing
                inwards towards the centre of the star, and the star continues to fall inwards towards the centre forever. 
                At this point, the star has become a black hole, and the is a point where light is not able to escape the 
                gravitational force, called the event horizon. (NASA, 2018) Black holes are not able to be observed directly 
                due to the fact they do not emit light but are able to be observed via the effects of their gravitational 
                fields on nearby matter. (NASA, 2018) In the movie, we can see a disk around Gargantua (the black hole), 
                called the accretion disk which is a flattened circular structure formed when material falls towards the 
                black hole due to its gravity. Due to the fact that angular momentum is conserved, the rotations of any 
                falling material is amplified, therefore colliding particles convert the kinetic energy of the collision 
                into heat, which causes them to release x-rays, which is important for astronomers as it is a way for them 
                to observe and locate black holes, (Black hole, 2023) for example Figure 2, which shows the accretion disk 
                of galaxy M87, which located the black hole allowing it to be photographed. In the film, Gargantua is seen
                to be black with a very bright accretion disk around it, but in real life, the doppler effect would have 
                impacted the accretion disk more, in which the approaching side of the disk would be more blueish white, 
                while the side receding would be much redder, as the disk is spinning very quickly. 
                
                The way Kip Thorne and Christopher Nolan depicted time dilation was through Miller’s planet, which orbited the 
                supermassive black hole Gargantua. Through some equations generated by physicist Kip Thorne, it was depicted that 
                every hour spent on Miller’s planet, seven hours would pass on Earth. As Cooper, the main character and his crew 
                travel down towards the planet, they find the wreckage of Miller’s ship, which was still fresh and all still 
                together. They soon realise that although Miller landed there 21 earth years ago, it would have only been three
                hours on that planet due to time dilation. Time dilation is a phenomenon which occurs due to the theory of special
                relativity, originally created by Albert Einstein. Special relativity explains how the speed of an object affects
                mass, time and space, as when objects are approaching the speed of light, the mass of the object becomes infinite
                therefore causes the energy required to move it to be infinite as well. (Johnson, 2021) Special relativity only applies
                to cases of which we are discussing about ultra-fast speeds, astronomical distances and huge energies, as objects 
                are needed to be travelling close to the speed of light. From the discovery of special relativity, Einstein tried 
                to account for all phenomenon, which led to the discovery of General relativity, which is the relationship between 
                gravity and time. (Johnson, 2021)  According to General relativity, the higher the mass of an object, the more it 
                warps space-time, seen in Figure 3. (Johnson, 2021)  Therefore the more it warps, time moves slower relative to other 
                objects when it is warped on the object. This explains the time dilation in the movie, as the planet was close to 
                Gargantua, the supermassive black hole which would have warped space time massively, therefore causing significant 
                amounts of time dilation when there.
                
                Another part to the movie was the wormholes, appearing within the first hour, the wormhole transported Cooper and 
                his crew towards Gargantua. Wormhoels are very theoretical, in which is a tunnel between two points in space time,
                such as black holes. It has not been proven that wormholes do exist but there is theory behind it. Figure 4 shows 
                how wormholes should theoretically work, as the blue is the fabric of space time, wormholes create a hole through
                it in which would allow for quick travel between one area in space to another quickly. This also is derived from 
                Einstein’s theory of general relativity, and also has been argued that a wormhole would allow for time travel into
                the past. (Perkowitz, 2019) However, in real life wormholes are unstable, and although there has been theories 
                proposed to stabilise them, there has been no evidence that they can work because there is no evidence that wormholes
                even exist. (Perkowitz, 2019)
